# Breakout

A simple Breakout game in React. It includes a couple basic levels and functionality to add your own (using code).

There were plans to add more features (such as power-ups) but there wasn't enough time as it was a timed school assignment.

## Features:
- Routing
- Localization
- Settings (persistent)
- Multiple levels with ability to add more
- Keyboard and mouse control

# Downsides
- Doesn't work on mobile (at all)
